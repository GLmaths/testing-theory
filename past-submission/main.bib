abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter describes the bar induction rule (BIR) for the systems that are introduced by Feferman and Friedman to formalize Bishop's constructive analysis (BCM) and also for some stronger systems of intuitionistic set theory. The systems considered in the chapter are divided into three groups: Feferman's systems for BCM, Friedman's systems for BCM, and proof theoretically strong subsystems of intuitionistic ZF set theory with the relativized dependent choice (IZF+RDC). Feferman's systems are based on the notions of functions and classifications, while Friedman's systems for BCM are the subsystems of IZF+RDC and are distinguished from the systems in the third group by their considerable lack of proof theoretic strength. BIR is a derived rule corresponding to the principle of BI, and the proofs of BIR described in the chapter are syntactical. The proof theoretical method is not flexible, and therefore it appears impossible to apply such a method directly to the systems discussed in the chapter. Two methods have been discussed to overcome this difficulty for the systems without sufficient inductive definitions and for the systems with sufficient inductive definitions; however, unfortunately, none of them is suitable for all systems.}

abstract="Concurrent strategies based on event structures are examined from the viewpoint of `may' and `must' testing in traditional process calculi. In their pure form concurrent strategies fail to expose the deadlocks and divergences that can arise in their composition. This motivates an extension of the bicategory of concurrent strategies to treat the `may' and `must' behaviour of strategies under testing. One extension adjoins neutral moves to strategies but in so doing loses identities w.r.t. composition. This in turn motivates another extension in which concurrent strategies are accompanied by stopping configurations; the ensuing stopping strategies inherit the structure of a bicategory from that of strategies. The technical developments converge in providing characterisations of the `may' and `must' equivalences and preorders on strategies.",

abstract = {The doubling of the number of transistors on a chip every 2 years, a seemly inevitable trend that has been called Moore's law, has contributed immensely to improvements in computer performance. However, silicon-based transistors cannot get much smaller than they are today, and other approaches should be explored to keep performance growing. Leiserson et al. review recent examples and argue that the most promising place to look is at the top of the computing stack, where improvements in software, algorithms, and hardware architecture can bring the much-needed boost. Science, this issue p. eaam9744 The miniaturization of semiconductor transistors has driven the growth in computer performance for more than 50 years. As miniaturization approaches its limits, bringing an end to Moore’s law, performance gains will need to come from software, algorithms, and hardware. We refer to these technologies as the “Top” of the computing stack to distinguish them from the traditional technologies at the “Bottom”: semiconductor physics and silicon-fabrication technology. In the post-Moore era, the Top will provide substantial performance gains, but these gains will be opportunistic, uneven, and sporadic, and they will suffer from the law of diminishing returns. Big system components offer a promising context for tackling the challenges of working at the Top.}
