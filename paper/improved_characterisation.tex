\section{Exploiting essential traces}
We now present two characterisation of $\testleqS$ that rely only on essential traces,
and we apply the coinductive one two prove a that a sequential version of Erathostene's Sieve
is improved on by a concurrent implementation.


\subsection{Use case}
Here we give the codes of the two algorithms,
and outline why they are related by the must preorder.
